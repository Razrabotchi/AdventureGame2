# AdventureGame2

This is a fairly simple console application made in C#. 
In this game, your task is quite simple - collect the ax parts that are mentioned in the game itself and kill the zombie boss. 
Also, this game, or rather the series of games, has a plot, which is described in the Plot.docx file.
This game also has the first part, unfortunately I donâ€™t have the source code, but you can see it as an exe file in this repository.
