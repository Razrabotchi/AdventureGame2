# About Music

Since I'm new to programming, I'm having problems with the sound files in Adventure Game 2. 
So you will have to do the following to ensure the music plays correctly. 
To get started, download the sound files and place them where it is convenient for you (preferably in the same folder). 
Then open the Program.cs file in Visual Studio, or if you don't have one, open the file in Notepad. 
Then scroll to about line 590 - 600 and where it says "name = new SoundPlayer(...)" you need to paste the files address where indicated. 
That's it, now the music works correctly and you can enjoy the game :)!

Note: 

Music can be turned off completely if you find the variable "music" 
in the project in line 573 and change its value from "true" to "false".
