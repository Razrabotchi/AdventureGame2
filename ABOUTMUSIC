Since I'm just a newbie programmer, I'm having trouble with the sound files in Adventure Game 2, 
so you'll have to do the following to get the music to play correctly. 
To get started, download the sound files and place them where it is convenient for you (preferably in the same folder). 
Then open the Program.cs file in Visual Studio, or if you don't have it, open the file in Notepad. 
Then scroll to about line 500 and where it says SoundPlayer <name> = new SoundPlayer(...) you need to insert the address of 
the files that you downloaded and save where indicated. That's it, now the music works correctly and you can enjoy the game :)!
