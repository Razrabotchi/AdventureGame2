Adventure Game 2
On behalf of Danil
Suddenly, a zombie boss burst into the house, who was most likely the same businessman. All the walls of the house collapsed from such a sharp and strong shock. The zombie boss immediately ran at me, but I saw a stone on the ground, picked it up and threw it at the zombie boss. He became disoriented and I took advantage of this moment to run to another part of the house. There I noticed an ax blade and thought that I could assemble a whole ax if I found all the parts to defeat the zombie boss. Not far away I found a handle, and then, when the zombie boss was almost catching me, I found a rope and tied the blade and handle of the ax. Then I attacked the zombie boss with an ax and defeated him.
